<h1>The Best Movies According to Maalik</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time:</h2><hr>

<h3>In the Heights</h3>
<p>Top-tier musical chronicling the convergence of many different lives in New York City.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter <em>movie series</em></h3>
<p>The first novel debuted while I was in middle school. I was on the waiting list to read each new release, aha. The movies tied together my imaginative eye with the author's vision.</p>

<h3>The Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>This movie has inspired me to remain persistent as I strive for my professional ambitions. It's about the journey a father takes to secure comfortability for his family.</p>
